# Running the skeletonization on a video
Download the AOF skeletons code and the main.py file. This should be run from the command line.  
Make sure that the python MATLAB engine is enabled wherever you run the file from.  
Run the command `python [path to file]/main.py --video [path to video]/video`.  
This will create 3 video feeds on top of each other: Frame Delta, Thresh (binary image), and the Skeletonized image.
